I found a very interesting thing that I would re-introduce myself again and again every 1 to 2 years due to different reasons. Last year before I came to Singapore, I was asked to take an interview at Jump Trading, so I wrote down my introduction in English in another place. Though I didn't make that interview at last, I could feel I was really enjoying the moment looking back. Today, I need to write an introduction about myself again since I want to set up an official personal blog, but also I did actually accumulated some experience during the last year. Without further ado, let's get it.    

## Before university
Unlike other programmers, I didn't take an OI competition or training before my university days, but the reason why I want to give some paragraphs to my junior and senior high school is that there were too much treasurable memory.                 

I was assigned to an English class in my junior high school, where we made much more efforts than the students in other classes in English. Our head teacher was very responsible, throughout the three-year class, he insisted in publishing weekly newspaper and hosting monthly speech contest. I really appreciated his consistency and extra efforts in our class, no one ever asked him to do so, but he would collect a short English passage, some English news and things happened in school to write the weekly paper and printed them to us. It was also the first time I understood practice makes perfect. Since we were asked to recite the English passage every week, so we had more opportunities to practice our verbal English as well as our reading ability. Most Chinese students find learning English hard because they are not afraid of opening their mouth and do not have the chance to say something in English. The repetitive practice undeniably set up a solid foundation for my English, and helping me get 148/150 in the National College Entrance Examination(NCEE). Again, I really appreciate my head teacher.      

After entering senior high school, I was assigned to competition class. Instead of Informatics competition, I chose Math competition at that time. Though due to many unexplainable reasons I switched to Physics competition in the second year, I really enjoy the environment in our class. Thanks to the competition opportunity, we could learn many knowledge in university ahead, for example, calculus, thermology, modern physics, etc. Limiting students in the high school's textbooks is really toxic from my personal view. Students are doing endless practice around some easy problems so as to get few scores higher in the NCEE. Though I didn't get full marks or even very high marks in the exam, I would choose to immerse myself in the competition again if I could re-start my senior high school life. Besides, we had the opportunities to go to other cities to do experiments, undertake training, participate in competitions, etc. These are all valuable memories in my mind.         

After taking the NCEE, I came to Beihang university, though it's not comparable with Tsinghua and Peking university, it is one of the top 10 universities in China, at least ranked by the difficulty of application.        

## University life
If you ask me why I would choose Computer Science as my major, I would not say it's out of interest or because I play computer games, since it's just a hot choice when I apply. Everyone knows Bytedance, Alibaba, and Tencent. Being a programmer is the easiest and most straightforward way of getting in that big names. Fortunately, I didn't find myself hating this major, instead, I found it interesting. By coding, I can implement some fantastic things, including building personal blogs, crawling online resources, monitoring tickets, and even some "illegal" things like network address translator in school internet. 

The most memorable thing in my bachelor degree is the Supercomputer Team. I joined in Sophomore and became the team leader in Senior and led our team participate the ASC20-21 in the last year. At there, I met with High-performance computing and found my future direction. 

There are two presses about our participation:

## Work experience
After graduating from Beihang university, I tried to find a job to validate my knowledge learned throughout the four years. Fortunately I joined Shopee as my first job and met a folk of lovely colleagues as well as nice leaders. I was a backend engineer responsible for the machine learning toolkit development. So somebody may ask, ***what's the relationship between your job and your HPC experience?*** Of course there is. Apart from developing the toolkit, I also helped optimize the machine learning distributed training process. Distributed training acts the same as the other problems we met in the HPC world, i.e., how to effectively eliminate the communication cost and maximum the overlap between the necessary communication part with computation. 

Life in Shopee is full of fun, the administrator team often holds party and give some gifts at every festival. However, saying goodbye is also a part of life, I resigned after working about eight months and embarked on my next journey.


## Postgraduate life
I didn't meet any unfairness or unhappiness in Shopee, but I still quitted and came to Singapore, purely because I wanna explore the world when I was young and when I didn't settle down.           

Singapore is not a bad choice overall, it's close to China, no racists, no extreme climates and pretty safe. National University of Singapore is also the top 1 university in Asia, ranking 11th in the QS. So why not give it a choice.           

I didn't step out of my comfort zone anyway, I chose the Machine Learning and Data Science as my postgraduate major, which is really similar to the work content right? But it is also a little bit challenging to me since I actually never systematically study the machine learning before. I was pushed to optimize the program at the very first day when I got exposed to the machine learning. Well in fact, it is also truth that you don't need to know too much about it and you can make something on it, but if you wanna make the things better, you may need to dig into it. I also have this kind of belief when I choose the major.       

To enrich my experience as well as making a living for the high cost in Singapore, I joined Sea AI Lab as a researcher engineer intern. In fact I found this job when I was in Shopee, you know Sea is the parent company of Shopee, so I secure the position before I arrive in Singapore. As a consequence, I started my academic and industry period exactly at the same time. Since it's a full-time intern, I go to work every workday from 10 to 7 and at the same time taking the classes in the evenings and weekends. Nobody know how I survive haha, since for those who take a part-time study in NUS, they only need to choose 1-2 courses every semester, but I choose 4 as a full-time student and full-time intern.                

The job market in IT is not promising since the pandemic, it's the same case in Singapore. Most companies prefer to hire local permanent residences and citizens since they do not need work visa. What's worse, most companies cut most of their headcounts to survive, especially Shopee. In the earlier years, Shopee expended dramatically in Singapore, hiring thousands of foreign students, it is the similar case in Bytedance and TikTok. Nevertheless, in this year, there are very few opening positions for graduate students and internships, so I stayed in Sea for another half year for preparation.                    

It's really frustrating when I started to apply for the summer internship jobs, since hardly can I receive an interview. I even don't know why my resume cannot pass the initial screen given that I have some competition prizes and work experience. I told myself, ***Always prepare for yourself.*** Opportunities are for those who are prepared, and you need to grasp it when it shows. Luckily, at the end of Feb, I started to receive some interviews, and at the end of Apr, I have received three offers with diversity. I finally declined TikTok since it has low probability of providing return offer and work visa, instead, I choose a quant company as my next journey. I cannot describe how thrilled I am when I receive the offer from the Quant company, since the very very initial plan of going to Singapore contains switching to Quant field from the Tech field. And now, I made it. 

## Others
Most of us are always admiring others life, but why comparing yourself with the others? Everyone is unique and a symbol of his/her growth. The all past experience builds the current me.                        

Sometimes we may find ourselves stuck in obstacles and difficulties, just like applying for hundreds of positions but receiving very few response. The only thing we can do is to equip ourselves and prepare ourselves, never give up, now I understand that sentence:    

> The best is yet to come.
