Hi, there!

I'm Cookie from China, currently a software/backend/machine learning engineer.      
My interest covers C++, HPC, Large-scale training and Functional programming.        
I'm a talkative man in the real world, so feel free to connect me via LinkedIn or Email.       
Here I will record some courses I learned, some techniques I used, and some personal mind expression.     

Anyway, if my blogs can help you, it's so great for me!

Plus, I'm also building a [HPC-wiki website](https://hpc-wiki.org), if you are also interested in it, you are very welcomed to contribute to this project.
