Not only then is the consulting industry indispensable, it is also large and diverse, with applications across every sector. That remains true in Singapore. Today, the industry is well-established and recognised as a key driver of Singapore&rsquo;s professional services sector. Looking forward, global trends in sustainability and digitalisation will continue to force organisations to rethink their modus operandi &mdash; many have and will thus enlist the help of consulting professionals to enable their transformation.

  <td hidden><p>Consulting is more than giving advice. It extends to providing information, redefining problems, creating targeted solutions &mdash; and perhaps beyond that, improving processes. In a nutshell, consulting is about problem-solving, or showing clients the way forward in a particular area of specialisation such as management, finance or operations. Not only then is the consulting industry indispensable, it is also large and diverse, with applications across every sector. That remains true in Singapore. Today, the industry is well-established and recognised as a key driver of Singapore&rsquo;s professional services sector. Many consulting firms have also partnered with the Singapore Economic Development Board on various endeavours in a bid to drive Singaporean innovation. Looking forward, global trends in sustainability and digitalisation will continue to force organisations to rethink their modus operandi &mdash; many have and will thus enlist the help of consulting professionals to enable their transformation. As the industry continues to grow and evolve, demand for professionals is only set to increase.</p>

This is due in no small part to the efforts of the Home Team, as well as the security industry consisting of over 200 security agencies and 600 security service providers which play a complementary role in ensuring the security of industrial, commercial, and residential premises, as well as events. With various opportunities available in law enforcement, private security, and security consultancy, demand for security services is also set to increase, arising from heightened threats of terrorism and an increase in the number of buildings and facilities in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
