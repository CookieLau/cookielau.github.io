<p>As we embrace the thriving digital world we live in, there are many of us who are being left behind. With Singapore as a digital hub, having digital access does not necessarily mean inclusion and groups should not be dismissed of their ability to be part of our digital future. The path of digital development should be wide enough to accommodate as many as possible, via sustainable means, and ensure progression together.</p>
<p>How can we seize the opportunities created through digital development and help individuals with different backgrounds to be empowered and thrive in our digital future? How can we help them to build confidence and improve their lives with the use of digital technologies?</p>
