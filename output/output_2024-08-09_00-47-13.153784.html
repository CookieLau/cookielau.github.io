We&rsquo;ll cover everything from debugging hidden elements to harnessing tools like Visual Coverage, Animation Timeline, Performance panels, and many more. Prepare to receive around 20 tips that will elevate your debugging game and streamline your workflow.<br />Many of us miss out on essential DevTools features simply because we assume they&rsquo;re common knowledge. Consider this an information buffet&mdash;I&rsquo;ll lay out a range of tools for you to choose from. Let&rsquo;s dive in with curiosity and reshape the way you approach debugging!</p>
