  <td hidden><p>Singapore accounts for a staggering 20% of the global semiconductor equipment output. Beyond the semiconductor industry, precision engineering plays a crucial role in many other industries including electronics, marine, offshore and aerospace by supplying critical products and expertise to manufacture complex components and equipment. Recognised as a leading regional hub for advanced manufacturing, Singapore has capabilities to produce wafer inspection tools that can identify nano-defects comparable to spotting a strand of hair from a height of 600m. With over 2,700 precision engineering firms in Singapore, the precision engineering industry contributed nearly 12% of total manufacturing output in 2022 &mdash; a figure which has grown over the years. Demand for high-precision components is expected to grow, driven by rising disposable incomes that fuel demand for high-precision components across automotive, medical technology, and aerospace industries, among others, hinting at a wealth of opportunity in the sector. Through Discover+: Precision Engineering, Advisory hopes to convene industry experts to discuss key opportunities in the field.</p>
