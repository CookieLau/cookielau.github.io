  <td hidden><p>Singapore is widely regarded as one of the safest countries in the world, ranking 3rd on the Economist Intelligence Unit&rsquo;s 2021 Safe City Index, especially in terms of infrastructure and personal security. This is due in no small part to the efforts of the Home Team, as well as the security industry consisting of over 200 security agencies and 600 security service providers which play a complementary role in ensuring the security of industrial, commercial, and residential premises, as well as events. With various opportunities available in law enforcement, private security, and security consultancy, demand for security services is also set to increase, arising from heightened threats of terrorism and an increase in the number of buildings and facilities in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
