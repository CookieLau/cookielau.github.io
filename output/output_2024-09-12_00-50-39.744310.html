  <td hidden><p>Gain valuable insights into how the challenges posed by the rapid growth of AI is being addressed, learn what a typical day is like for engineers at Applied Materials and explore exciting career opportunities available for postgraduate students eager to contribute to the future of AI technology!</p>
<p>Applied Materials is the leader in materials engineering solutions used to produce virtually every new chip and advanced display in the world. For more than 55 years, their innovations have improved the lives of billions of people around the globe.</p>
<p>Applied Materials believes that AI represents the most significant inflection point of our time. However, the power required to support the growth of AI is driving energy consumption to new levels. Power is becoming a much more important variable, and the demand for more power-efficient solutions to intensify is expected. In this AI inflection, there is an increasing role of materials innovation in enabling chipmaker roadmaps in logic, DRAM, high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced packaging, all of which are critical to improving chip performance-per-watt requirements.</p>
