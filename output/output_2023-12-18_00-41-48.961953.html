  <td hidden><p>LTA spearheads land transport developments in Singapore. We chart the future of land transport through master plans, and continually look at ways where we can enhance reliability of public transport systems, support options for walking and cycling, while improving road connectivity. Our work is diverse, and the Land Transport Enthusiast Programme 2023: December Series is a series of half-day programmes to share about the intricacies behind our land transport system. Join us as we explore Railway Operations &amp; Maintenance, visit the new TEL 4 Marine Parade station, and learn about how Active Mobility is growing as a new form of travel!</p>
<p>Want to know how you can do your part to lead a sustainable lifestyle? Active mobility can reduce our carbon emissions while promoting active lifestyles.

  <td hidden><p>Singapore&rsquo;s legal industry is widely recognised as one of the most sophisticated and developed in the world, evidenced by its consistently high rankings on indices like the World Justice Project&rsquo;s Rule of Law Index. As a result of Singapore&rsquo;s strong adherence to rule of law, this has been instrumental in maintaining an effective and efficient justice system, political and social stability as well as investor confidence to drive growth. Our focus on areas like finance, corporate and intellectual property law coupled with strong legal infrastructure further supports business activities and thereby contributes to the economy. To keep pace with current trends in the legal industry such as the heightened adoption and innovative development of legal technology, Singapore has invested significantly in infrastructure development while creating platforms for the sharing of best practices such as TechLaw.Fest. Opportunities for growth in Singapore&rsquo;s legal industry remain aplenty through scholarships, partnerships with universities, opportunities for mentorships, internships and clerkships for students. This goes hand in hand with professional development programmes such as the Singapore-Shanghai Lawyers Exchange Programme. While many students may be aware of the industry and its economic importance, they may lack opportunities to learn about the various occupations within this industry, what areas of the industry may best suit them, and how to position themselves to join it. Therefore, Advisory hopes to bridge this information gap by connecting students with professionals from a range of roles within this field through Discover+: Legal.</p>
