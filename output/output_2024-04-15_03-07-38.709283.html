<p>The CSP Forum was conceptualised by Business China in conjunction with River Valley High School. This annual event serves as a platform for Singaporean youths to gain insights into China&rsquo;s development and deepen their understanding of our region. <br />
This year, the forum would explore the dynamic interactions at the intersection of technology, international relations, and economic development within Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>In the contemporary global political and economic milieu, Southeast Asian nations are strategically navigating their interests, endeavouring to strike a delicate equilibrium between engaging with both China and the United States. The objective of this forum is to delve into the evolving landscape of technological cooperation between China and Southeast Asia, scrutinizing both the burgeoning opportunities and the intricate challenges that emerge within the ambit of US-China rivalry. A significant focus will be placed on analysing how Southeast Asian countries can leverage their technological collaborations with China to catalyse local technological innovation and facilitate industrial advancement.</p>
