Kitty Bu is an impact-driven leader passionate about catalysing system transitions towards a net-zero economy.</p>
<p>For over a decade, Kitty has dedicated herself to advancing the transition of the energy and agriculture systems to a low-carbon future. She focuses on the nexus of business, policy and finance, working with a range of partners to foster the conditions for disruptive technologies and business models to take root and thrive.</p>

Reinventing Fire: China, a landmark collaboration with the Chinese government, laid out this pathway in a clear and ambitious way that helped inform discussions on the energy transition in China.</p>
<p>Kitty later shifted to pushing for the shift away from fossil fuel and towards clean energy in Asia and around the globe, working with the European Climate Foundation (ECF) first as its Asia Finance Lead, and later launching a new practice focused on the scaling of renewable energy globally.</p>

At Impossible, she focused on opening new markets in Asia, leading market entry strategies and working with government agencies to create the pathway for approvals of Impossible&rsquo;s high-tech food products.</p>
<p>At GEAPP, Kitty leads a team that identifies and executes opportunities to catalyse investment in clean energy in Asia, supporting the mission of decarbonising the energy system while improving people&rsquo;s livelihoods as part of a just transition away from fossil fuels.&nbsp; <br />
